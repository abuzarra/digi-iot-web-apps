# Digi IoT Web Applications

This repository contains the source code of the web applications of the Digi
IoT solution demos, which demonstrate the end-to-end connection technology
using Digi products and services.

The web applications are built with the Django framework and can be run locally.
They use the [Python Device Cloud Library](https://github.com/digidotcom/python-devicecloud)
to communicate with Digi Remote Manager and manage the devices set up for the
demo.
